        <h2>About DEBRIS</h2>
        <p>
          In the face of natural or man-made disaster, urban search and rescue
          teams and other first responders like police, medical units or civil
          protection race against the clock to locate survivors within the
          critical 72-hour timeframe (Golden Hours), facing challenges such as
          instable structures or hazardous environments but also insufficient
          situational awareness â€“ all resulting in lengthy SaR processes. In
          order to speed up the detection of survivors trapped in collapsed
          buildings and to improve working conditions for the first responders.
        </p>
        <p>
          DEBRIS project develops a new class of robots designed to navigate and
          explore underground environments with limited access. Unlike
          traditional rigid robots, DEBRIS robots incorporate soft and flexible
          materials, enabling them to traverse complex and confined spaces such
          as soil, underground pipes, or tunnels. This flexibility allows the
          robots to move through debris and other obstructions that would be
          impassable for conventional machines.
        </p>

          The primary objective of DEBRIS (Detection and Exploration Bot for
          Rescue, Investigation, and Survival) is to develop an advanced,
          user-friendly Search and Rescue (SaR) system designed to rapidly and
          accurately detect and locate individuals trapped in disaster zones.
          DEBRIS aims to significantly reduce response times by utilizing a
          sophisticated integration of sensor data and real-time camera feeds to
          create a unified, comprehensive operational overview. This system will
          support the prioritization and execution of critical actions during
          SaR missions, thereby enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of
          rescue operations and increasing the likelihood of saving lives.
