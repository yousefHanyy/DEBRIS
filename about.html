                  In the face of natural or man-made disaster, urban search and
                  rescue teams and other first responders like police, medical
                  units or civil protection race against the clock to locate
                  survivors within the critical 72-hour timeframe (Golden
                  Hours), facing challenges such as instable structures or
                  hazardous environments but also insufficient situational
                  awareness â€“ all resulting in lengthy SaR processes. In order
                  to speed up the detection of survivors trapped in collapsed
                  buildings and to improve working conditions for the first
                  responders.

                  DEBRIS, an advanced robotic system designed for navigating
                  challenging environments to aid in rescue operations,
                  investigations, and survival scenarios. Equipped with sensors
                  and a camera, DEBRIS gathers crucial data and imagery, which
                  is then transmitted to a central hub for real-time analysis
                  and decision-making.

                  The primary objective of DEBRIS (Detection and Exploration Bot
                  for Rescue, Investigation, and Survival) is to develop an
                  advanced, user-friendly Search and Rescue (SaR) system
                  designed to rapidly and accurately detect and locate
                  individuals trapped in disaster zones. DEBRIS aims to
                  significantly reduce response times by utilizing a
                  sophisticated integration of sensor data and real-time camera
                  feeds to create a unified, comprehensive operational overview.
                  This system will support the prioritization and execution of
                  critical actions during SaR missions, thereby enhancing the
                  efficiency and effectiveness of rescue operations and
                  increasing the likelihood of saving lives.
