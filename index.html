      (1)Designing the main portion of the page (Assuming the website consists of one page):

          |> Dividing the page into three portions (three divs):
              ||> First portion should be the header:
                  |||> 1-Create a main div as a container.
                      ||||> -Add a h1 indicating the name of the project.
                      ||||> -<Under it a quick one line summary in a 'p' tag.
                      ||||> -Maybe a background image related to the project context (NOT RECOMMENDED FOR AS MUCH PERFORMANCE BOOST AS POSSIBLE).

              ||> Second portion is for both the live stream & the camera images(normal or thermal):

              ||> Third portion is for the sensor readings:
                  |||> 1-Create a main div as a container.
                      ||||> -The display style should be flex and should wrap.
                  |||> 2-Create as much divs as needed for the readings in the container.
                      ||||> -Each readings div should have a name and the specified number (preferably add an icon indicating each one).
                            |||||> -Temperature readings.
                            |||||> -Pressure readings.
                            |||||> -Humidity readings.
                            |||||> -Doppler reading (motion detection).
                            |||||> -Final conclusion by the AI model if a body is found.

      <p>
        An advanced robotic system designed for navigating challenging
        environments to aid in rescue operations, investigations, and survival
        scenarios. Equipped with sensors and a camera, DEBRIS gathers crucial
        data and imagery, which is then transmitted to a central hub for
        real-time analysis and decision-making.
